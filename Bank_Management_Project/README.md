<== UPDATED ==>\

Note: I didn't really change much, but to be more easier and efficient to change, and
tried to fix bugs, that were the gave the most problems. Creating this project to be
having much of an improvement then the first version of this project.\

<== Updated Description ==>\
Updated the project, to being more efficient and easier to maintain as well as being
able to be changed, by directory paths.\

Easy to access, directories, file paths, and folders\

Make the code cleaner, and this update will show the code to be the best version then
the previous versions.\

NOTE: All these accounts, including the account managers account are all created in
a binary file.\

<== IMPORTANT PLEASE READ ==>\
The program used files on my local directory on my system, therefore it may 
or may not work. Which, is the reason I will update the project, is to be efficient.
Which then, the project should be able to adapt to the changes that could possibly 
go in this project.\
